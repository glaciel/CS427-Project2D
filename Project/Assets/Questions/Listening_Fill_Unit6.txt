26;As soon as the food _____ the floor, it’s unsafe to eat it because it picks up bacteria immediately.;touches
27;However, sometimes there are ______ of a disease which are unexpected or in new places and nobody understands why so many people are getting sick.;outbreaks
28;In these situations, we need the help of researchers who work like detectives to try to _____ ___ the causes.;figure out
29;In both cases, the researchers needed to carry out in-depth investigations to find out the causes of these ______.;epidemics
30;The first situation ______ a disease called Schistosomiasis.;concerns
31;Schistosomiasis is caused by a _____ that lives in snails.;parasite
32;If people go into a river where the snails live, the parasite can get ______ by the water from the snail to the people’s skin, where is it begins to grow, and the people become quite sick.;transmitted

35;And yet by 1988, the ____ majority of the population, 90% in fact, had come down with the disease.;vast
36;Finding a solution to this health crisis became _____.;critical
37;Researchers looked at many clues, including the increase in snails in the Senegal river. This is what they ______.;determined
38;The dam _____ the water in the river to flow differently.;caused
39;This changed the prawns’ habitat and the prawns became ______.;extinct
40;When all the prawns died off, there was nothing to eat the snails. The snail population increased _____ in the river.;rapidly
41;This, in turn led to more parasites in the river water, and _____ many people were very ill.;suddenly
42;The next _____ was to find a solution.;challenge
43;The medicine they have treats the disease, it doesn’t prevent it.;treats
44;As soon as people _____ from the disease, they get sick again.;recover
45;It may seem like a good solution would be to _____ the disease by killing the snails.;eliminate
46;However, they decided that a better long-term approach was to try to restore the environmental conditions of the river so that prawns would be able to _____ there again.;survive
47;Their reasoning was that once prawns lived in the river again, the prawns would eat the _____, and there would be no more disease.;snails
48;A project called Project Crevette is _____ to do this.;working
49;This approach to solving a health problem is significant because it _____ the root cause of the disease rather than simply giving people medicine to treat the disease.;addresses
50;Another ______ disease which required a certain amount of detective work was in Guam, where the Chamorro people had a disease called lytico-bodig.;mysterious
51;The disease began early in the 20th century, reached its peak around ____ and then died out.;1940
52;Researchers wanted to ______ what caused the disease to appear and then disappear.;determine

56;This seemed like a valid explanation, except for two factors: one, before the seeds were made into flour, they were ____ to remove the toxin and, two, men and women ate roughly the same amount of the flour.;washed
57;The researchers had to ___ further. They studied the diet of men and women more carefully.;dig
58;They ______ that men ate more of one kind of animal: flying fox.;discovered
59;This led ______ to an interesting discovery: the same seeds the Chamorro people used to cook with were also a basic part of the flying fox’s diet.;researchers
60;They also found that the seed toxin became highly _______ in the meat of the flying foxes.;concentrated
61;Since men ate more flying foxes than women did, this helped to ____ why more men had the disease.;explain
62;Researchers also learned that when the population of flying foxes began to decline due to overhunting, the ______ of the disease also started to decrease.;incidence
63;When the flying foxes became ______, no one could eat them regularly.;endangered
64;The result was that the disease disappeared completely, and the people’s health was _____.;restored
65;These are just two examples of the various factors that need to be taken into account when investigating an _____ incidence of a disease.;unusual
